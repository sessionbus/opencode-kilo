## Current source candidate

The current source candidate targets native 7.6.2 and uses the shared Go/native
plugin implementation documented in [the Kilo installation guide](../../kilo/README.md).
Its controlled source tests do not constitute installed acceptance. The historical
7.5.6 facts below remain provenance, not authority for the new transport or current
host state. Installed metadata was 7.5.16 at the post-reboot read-only preflight.

## Explicit lane bypass restoration

Native 7.6.2 at commit `3d04228b6a642acb3daf68a649269618b6018250`
accepts a permission ruleset on session creation and update
(`packages/opencode/src/server/routes/instance/httpapi/handlers/session.ts:170-214`).
Its own session-scoped auto-approve mechanism writes
`{permission: "*", pattern: "*", action: "allow"}`
(`packages/opencode/src/kilocode/permission/allow-everything.ts:16,38-45`),
and identifies that rule as YOLO in
`packages/opencode/src/kilocode/permission/provenance.ts:19-21`.
The tool ask path merges session rules, retaining native Ask/Plan hard rules
(`packages/opencode/src/kilocode/session/prompt.ts:283-381`), and native permission
resolution still enforces protected config, skill-shell and sandbox-escalation
handling (`packages/opencode/src/permission/index.ts:202-262`).

The earlier 0.4 mapping cited below already supported explicit bypass. The shared
wrapper's later blanket rejection of nondefault Kilo modes prevented that caller
choice even though its existing session client could send the supported rule.
The restoration accepts only `bypassPermissions` in addition to omitted/default;
ordinary operation sends no permission override. Fresh and resumed lanes use the
existing native session API. No global config, automatic permission replies, or
Sessionbus custom-tool behavior is changed. Controlled fake-native tests cover
both paths and default inheritance.

## Installed restoration checks

On native Kilo 7.6.2, permanent candidate
`66ebd5338c98ec478794981953fdc66c190d1d56` passed Sessionbus list/send checks
for ordinary and explicit-bypass lanes, ordinary peer, and peer `--yolo`.
Each send had a settled injected receipt and direct receiver observation;
Sessionbus requested no approval. Owned sessions/processes were cleaned up and
the daemon remained healthy.

The ordinary peer's unrelated file command raised a native permission prompt.
The operator intended to reject it but accidentally selected Allow once; native
recorded `approved by you`, and the owned marker file was created, hashed, and
removed. The prompt establishes that the unrelated tool remained gated. The
intended rejection check is inconclusive, was not repeated, and is not claimed
as a pass.

## Historical 0.4 evidence

- Kilo Code was pinned as CLI and plugin version `7.5.6`. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/kilocode/kilocode.go:14`, `ff81565:integrations/kilo/package.json:29-30`]
- Kilo loads both `.opencode/plugins` and `.kilo/plugins`; installing the same plugin in both places causes a double load. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/README.md:3-5`]
- A managed headless server is started as `kilo serve --hostname <loopback-host> --port <port> ...` in the requested cwd, authenticated by `KILO_SERVER_USERNAME` and `KILO_SERVER_PASSWORD`. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/server.go:84-130`]
- Server readiness is HTTP `GET /doc` and requires the documented `/session` and `/event` paths. The exact successful fixture is `{"paths":{"/session":{},"/event":{}}}`. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/server.go:128-143`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:295-312`]
- Native session, message, and permission IDs use the closed `ses_*`, `msg_*`, and `per_*` grammars, with a 256-byte maximum. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:25-29`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:70-90`]
- Fresh creation is `POST /session?directory=<cwd>` with JSON `{"title":"<title>","permission":[{"permission":"*","pattern":"*","action":"ask|allow"}]}` and a response containing the native `ses_*` ID. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:201-224`]
- Exact resume first fetches `GET /session/<ses_id>?directory=<cwd>` and requires the returned ID to match. The full TUI is then attached as `kilo attach <endpoint> --dir <cwd> --session <ses_id> ...`; latest-session fallback is rejected. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:227-239`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/server.go:246-264`, `ff81565:integrations/kilo/README.md:7-14`]
- `kilo attach --mini` is not a verified peer surface. `--mini`, user session selectors, `--continue`, fork selectors, endpoint/auth overrides, and server subcommands are rejected by the old exact attach builder. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/server.go:246-282`, `ff81565:integrations/kilo/README.md:7-14`]
- Kilo's native exact-session TUI selector is `POST /tui/select-session?directory=<cwd>` with `{"sessionID":"ses_exact"}` and must return JSON `true`; `false` is rejection and 404 means the exact session is gone. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:242-261`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:125-169`]
- A turn uses the shared `POST /session/<ses_id>/prompt_async?directory=<cwd>` shape `{"messageID":"msg_<deterministic-id>","noReply":false,"parts":[{"type":"text","text":"input"}]}` with optional native `model`, `agent`, and `variant`, and HTTP 204 acceptance. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:281-312`]
- Kilo's v2 event stream is unscoped `GET /api/session/<ses_id>/event`, not the directory-query `/event` route. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:575-584`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:231-243`]
- The exact v2 permission fixture is `{"type":"permission.v2.asked","data":{"id":"per_kilo","sessionID":"ses_kilo","action":"bash","resources":[]}}`; the exact completed turn fixture is `{"type":"session.turn.close","properties":{"sessionID":"ses_kilo","reason":"completed"}}`. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:239-244`]
- Kilo permission reply is unscoped `POST /api/session/<ses_id>/permission/<per_id>/reply` with `{"reply":"once|always|reject"}` and HTTP 204. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:682-691`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:244-252`]
- Kilo interrupt is unscoped `POST /api/session/<ses_id>/interrupt` with `{}` and HTTP 204. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:320-327`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:253-268`]
- Terminality is reconciled from `GET /session/<ses_id>/message` after the admitted user `msg_*`. Unlike OpenCode, a completed Kilo assistant message with `finish:"unknown"` is accepted as terminal. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:377-381`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:401-483`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:363-393`]
- Native delete is `DELETE /session/<ses_id>?directory=<cwd>`; JSON `true` and an already-absent 404 both converge successfully. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client.go:339-357`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/client_test.go:171-189`]
- Default permission maps to `{"permission":"*","pattern":"*","action":"ask"}` and bypass to the same wildcard rule with `"action":"allow"`; other shared modes are unsupported. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/permission.go:8-20`, `ff81565:internal/products/kilocode/permission_test.go:11-27`]
- Plugin identity arrives through native `session.created`, `session.updated`, and `session.deleted` events. IDs are read from `properties.info.id`, `properties.session.id`, or `properties.sessionID`; title and directory come from the corresponding session object. [Kilo plugin 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:36-50`, `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:163-195`]
- The plugin writes a requested fresh title with `client.session.update({path:{id},query:{directory},body:{title}})` and requires the SDK to echo it before reporting presence. [Kilo plugin 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:168-189`]
- The `shell.env` hook receives the exact `sessionID` from Kilo and validates `ses_*` before exporting it for child tool processes. [Kilo plugin 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:198-209`]
- Interactive delivery uses Kilo's TUI controller in this exact order: `clearPrompt({query:{directory}})`, `appendPrompt({query:{directory},body:{text}})`, then `submitPrompt({query:{directory}})`. Each call must return HTTP 200 and data `true`. [Kilo plugin 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:125-143`]
- After submit, the plugin polls `session.messages` until it sees a new user `msg_*` for the exact session containing the exact delivered text; only that transcript evidence acknowledges acceptance. [Kilo plugin 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:84-100`, `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:144-155`]
- The verified TUI delivery path submits a prompt and therefore starts product work. No append-without-run or running-turn injection primitive was established by the 0.4.0 code; the Go lane explicitly returned unsupported steer. [Kilo Code 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:125-160`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/lane.go:259-261`]
- Sessionbus tool ingress was the in-process `@kilocode/plugin` tool API, not MCP. The tool receives exact `context.sessionID`, `context.messageID`, and `context.abort`; this proves the plugin path and does not prove Kilo lacks other MCP support. [Kilo plugin 7.5.6; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:1-4`, `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:211-228`]
- UNVERIFIED before a new wrapper: Kilo is not installed on `umka-dev1`; its installed SDK/CLI version pair, v2 capability probe, and app-ready boundary have no host evidence. The signed design forbids hello until that probe succeeds. [Kilo version pending installation; source: `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1580-1585`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1752`]
- UNVERIFIED before a new wrapper: any session-level append or confirmed running-turn injection primitive. The captured TUI sequence submits a new prompt, and the Go lane rejected steer. [Kilo version pending installation; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:125-160`, `ff81565:internal/products/opencodefamily/lane.go:259-261`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1584`]
- UNVERIFIED before a new wrapper: native MCP transport/configuration support. The verified ingress is the in-process Kilo plugin API, and the planned wrapper keeps the JS kit and tool there. [Kilo version pending installation; source: `ff81565:integrations/kilo/agent-sessions.mjs:211-228`, `91fdcb3:docs/designs/UNIVERSAL-SESSION-PROTOCOL.md:1583`]
